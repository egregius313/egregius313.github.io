# Advice and Resources

## Text Editors

**If you're happy with the text editor/ide you use, you can skip this.**

One of the simultaneously most and least important choices you can
make is what text editor/IDE you use. There are three main sections of
text editors (that are widely used): old school (Vim and Emacs),
modern text editors ([Sublime Text], [Atom], [VS Code]), and IDEs
([Eclipse], [Visual Studio], [PyCharm], ...). While it is useful to
know how to use Vim and/or Emacs, they both use keybindings which most
people aren't used to, so they wouldn't be a good starting point. I
would suggest using a modern text editor like [VS Code] or [Sublime
Text] for scripting languages (Python, Javascript, Ruby, shell) and
sticking with an IDE like [Eclipse] or [IntelliJ]. (For IDEs I'd
suggest JetBrains IDEs. They are really great at what they do, and
they have a very generous student discount).


## Installing a VM (virtual machine)

**You can skip this at first, but it will be important later on.**

There is only so much you can do with Windows, and you will eventually
need to learn how to use a Unix/Linux system. Dual booting can cause
issues if you're using Windows and don't have a dedicated hard drive,
so I would suggest setting up a virtual machine running either
[Ubuntu] or [Linux Mint] to start off. For running the virtual
machine, one of the most popular choices is [Virtualbox].

This won't be necessary until you begin learning how to do things in
Unix/Linux, but don't put it off because then you won't seriously
cover the basics of using Unix until CS 392 (systems).


## Python

My language of choice, there is a lot of good Python material out
there.


## Java

The language used in CS 284 and can be useful for understanding a lot
of computer science material, because it used to be the most popular
college programming language until the past few years.

- The [Codecademy] course for Java isn't bad for learning the basics.
- After learning the basics, you can practice with challenges on
  [HackerRank].
