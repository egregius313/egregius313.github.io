<p><strong>If you’re happy with the text editor/ide you use, you can skip this.</strong></p>
<p>One of the simultaneously most and least important choices you can make is what text editor/IDE you use. There are three main sections of text editors (that are widely used): old school (Vim and Emacs), modern text editors (<a href="https://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a>), and IDEs (<a href="https://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, [Visual Studio], <a href="https://jetbrains.com/pycharm">PyCharm</a>, …). While it is useful to know how to use Vim and/or Emacs, they both use keybindings which most people aren’t used to, so they wouldn’t be a good starting point. I would suggest using a modern text editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a> or <a href="https://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> for scripting languages (Python, Javascript, Ruby, shell) and sticking with an IDE like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> or <a href="https://jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ</a>. (For IDEs I’d suggest JetBrains IDEs. They are really great at what they do, and they have a very generous student discount).</p>

<p><strong>You can skip this at first, but it will be important later on.</strong></p>
<p>There is only so much you can do with Windows, and you will eventually need to learn how to use a Unix/Linux system. Dual booting can cause issues if you’re using Windows and don’t have a dedicated hard drive, so I would suggest setting up a virtual machine running either <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> or <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> to start off. For running the virtual machine, one of the most popular choices is <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtualbox</a>.</p>
<p>This won’t be necessary until you begin learning how to do things in Unix/Linux, but don’t put it off because then you won’t seriously cover the basics of using Unix until CS 392 (systems).</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>My language of choice, there is a lot of good Python material out there.</p>
<h2 id="java">Java</h2>
<p>The language used in CS 284 and can be useful for understanding a lot of computer science material, because it used to be the most popular college programming language until the past few years.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> course for Java isn’t bad for learning the basics.</li>
<li>After learning the basics, you can practice with challenges on <a href="https://hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>.</li>
