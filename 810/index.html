	<p>
	  A small blog about topics in computer science I find interesting. These
	  are divided into subjects to attempt to make things more logical. It is
	  referred to as "ed's 810 because of the convention at Stevens for 
	  experimental classes to be labeled CS 810.
	</p>

	<h2>Subjects</h2>

	<ul>
	  <li>810e - Data Structures and Algorithms for Text Editing and Text Processing</li>
	  <li>810f - Functional Paradigms for Designing and Implementing Software</li>
	  <li>810n - Programming with Nothing: Restricted computing</li>
	</ul>
